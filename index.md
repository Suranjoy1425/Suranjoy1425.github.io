# About Me:

![Profile](/File/profile.jpg) 

**Bijoychandra Takhellambam** is a Ph.D. candidate from the [Department of Biosystem Engineering, Auburn University](https://www.eng.auburn.edu/bsen/). He holds a Master in Hydrology from [Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, India](https://hy.iitr.ac.in/). His work focuses on climate impacts on water resources, including rainfall erosivity, hydroclimatic extremes, and hydrological modeling. Past research includes Developed soil erosion model for estimation of a small-hilly watershed area using the Watershed Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model, **Cost-effective combination of T-head groynes for river bank protection**, and hydraulic modeling using 1-D HEC-RAS for flood discharge estimation using at-site stage information. He is currently working in **Climate Change Implications on Rainfall Erosivity and Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) Curves with Downscaled Precipitation Data over the Southeast United States**.

His publications and CV are available in the tabs above. The Google Scholar page may be found [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=I6bZieUAAAAJ&hl=en). You may reach him at tzs0075@auburn.edu. 


In free time, he enjoys most types of games and sports, particularly soccer, cricket, Table Tennis, Volleyball, and Hiking.

# Research Interest:

- ## Developemnt of high-temproal resolution datasets"
The study of climate impacts onw ater resoruces required high-temporal resolution datasets. For isntance, sub-hourly rainfall datasets for quanitfying the imaopct of cliamt eon soil erosion, flood discahrge. However, the availabel climate datasets are available in aggregated daatsets such as hourly or daily. Therefore, limtied avaliable of sub-hourly dataasets are requried to develop for a preicse estiamtion.
