**Suranjoy S. Singam** is an Advanced Sustainability Materials Engineer at the [CNH Industrial, Canada](https://www.cnh.com/) He holds a PhD (2022) in Biological Engineering from the [School of Engineering, University of Guelph, Canada](https://www.uoguelph.ca/). He received his Master (M.Tech) in Food Process Engineering from the [Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India](https://iitkgp.ac.in). Before joining CNH Industrial, he worked as a Postdoctoral Researcher in the [Food Packaging and Biomaterials Lab](https://www.uoguelph.ca/foodscience/people/loong-tak-lim) at the [Department of Food Science](https://www.uoguelph.ca/foodscience/), University of Guelph, Canada. His research focuses on the valorization and bioprocessing of food, agricultural, and industrial biomass wastes to develop novel sustainable, advanced functional biobased materials. Primary research areas are the modification and functionalization of cellulose and lignin-based materials. Special interest in electrospinning technique to develop submicron-sized fibers for food and non-food applications, such as antimicrobial and highly efficient filtration systems, and functional bioactive carrier systems in packaging applications. He is currently working on applications of sustainable materials (e.g., natural fibers or bioplastics) to develop biodegradable/compostable product components for agricultural practices [Compostable Bale Net Wrap](https://media.cnh.com/north-america/cnh/cnh-invests-in-ecofriendly-bale-storage-innovator-nature-s-net-wrap/s/1f725361-ccb2-45df-a4f0-a67e7f9ed893) and lightweight biocomposite machine components. His Google Scholar page may be found [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QLhj2j4AAAAJ&hl=en). You may reach him at suranjoy.singam@cnh.com. 

He likes outdoor activities and sports in his spare time, including wildlife photography, soccer, cricket, table tennis, volleyball, and hiking.
