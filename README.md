# ABOUT ME:

<img align="left" width="200" src="/File/profile.png">


**Bijoychandra Takhellambam** is a Ph.D. candidate from the [Department of Biosystem Engineering, Auburn University](https://www.eng.auburn.edu/bsen/). He holds a Master in Hydrology from [Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, India](https://hy.iitr.ac.in/). His work focuses on climate impacts on water resources, including rainfall erosivity, hydroclimatic extremes, and hydrological modeling. Past research includes *developing Best Practice Management (BMPs) using soil erosion model for a small-hilly watershed*, *Cost-effective combination of T-head groynes for river bank protection*, and *hydraulic modeling using 1-D [Hydrologic Engineering Center's (CEIWR-HEC) River Analysis System (HEC-RAS)](https://www.hec.usace.army.mil/software/hec-ras/) for flood discharge estimation using at-site stage information*. He is currently working in *Climate Change Implications on Rainfall Erosivity and Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) Curves with Downscaled Precipitation Data over the Southeast United States*. His Google Scholar page may be found [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=I6bZieUAAAAJ&hl=en). You may reach him at tzs0075@auburn.edu. 


He likes activities and sports in his spare time, including soccer, cricket, table tennis, volleyball, and hiking.
