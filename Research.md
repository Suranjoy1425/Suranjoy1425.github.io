    <p><strong>Climate Change Implications on Rainfall and its Characteristics</strong><br>
    The study developed high-temporal resolution precipitation data using in-situ and NetCDF datasets, and created <a href="https://github.com/bijoychandraAU/PrecipTDS">PrecipTDS</a>, an R-package for generating future 15-minute rainfall projections from various climate models. It quantified mid-century rainfall erosivity under climate change in the Southeast United States and developed artificial neural network-powered rainfall intensity-duration-frequency curves for future climate scenarios. Additionally, the study quantified uncertainty in these curves using bootstrapping resampling techniques.</p>
