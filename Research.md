In recent years, the escalating environmental concerns associated with single-use plastic packaging have prompted an urgent need for sustainable alternatives. My overarching research goal is to harness the untapped potential of locally available food and agricultural biomass wastes to create biodegradable biobased food packaging with advanced active functionalities, addressing crucial challenges in the field. Specifically, I aim to develop innovative packaging solutions that cater to diverse needs, including water-resistant paper-based packaging tailored for high-moisture foods, packaging incorporating super absorbents for enhanced freshness, and packaging with controlled release functions of active components, such as antimicrobials and insecticides.

    <p><strong>Climate Change Implications on Rainfall and its Characteristics</strong><br>
    The study developed high-temporal resolution precipitation data using in-situ and NetCDF datasets, and created <a href="https://github.com/bijoychandraAU/PrecipTDS">PrecipTDS</a>, an R-package for generating future 15-minute rainfall projections from various climate models. It quantified mid-century rainfall erosivity under climate change in the Southeast United States and developed artificial neural network-powered rainfall intensity-duration-frequency curves for future climate scenarios. Additionally, the study quantified uncertainty in these curves using bootstrapping resampling techniques.</p>

    <p><strong> Hydraulic Modeling for River Discharge</strong><br>
    This reseaerch conducted through analysis using the HEC-RAS hydraulic model to evaluate 1-D unsteady flow, focusing on two prominent rivers: Chattahoochee and Godavari. Collected and analyzed daily weather station data alongside meticulously measured river cross-sections and flow discharge. Resulted in the development of a comprehensive HEC-RAS model, contributing to a deeper understanding of hydraulic dynamics and water resource management. </p>
