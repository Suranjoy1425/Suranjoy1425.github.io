# Teaching Assistant & Tutoring:
During my PhD program at the <a href="https://www.uoguelph.ca/">University of Guelph</a>, I worked as a Teaching Assistant for the following courses:

    <p><strong> 1. <a href="https://www.uoguelph.ca/engineering/system/files/3430_3.pdf">Heat & Mass Transfer</strong><br>
 This course is to introduce the basic principles of heat and mass transfer with emphasis on their analysis and applications to practical engineering problems.</p>

<p><strong> 2. <a href="https://www.uoguelph.ca/engineering/course-outlines/material-science-engg2120">Material Science</strong><be>
This course offers an introduction to materials science, focusing on the atomic or molecular structures of metals, polymers, ceramics, and composites. Students will explore how these structures affect mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties. Variations in material properties often stem from differences in atomic structure.</p>

<p><strong> 3. <a href="https://www.uoguelph.ca/engineering/course-outlines/material-science-engg2120">Food Packaging</strong><be>
The course analyzes the roles of packaging in food preservation systems through an overview of contemporary packaging materials, their characteristics, manufacturing techniques, and their tailored uses for particular products. Furthermore, it will cover regulatory, environmental, and market factors affecting decisions in food packaging selection.</p>

<p><strong> 4. <a href="https://www.uoguelph.ca/engineering/system/files/4340.pdf">Solid & Hazardous Waste Management</strong><be> 

This course offers students insights into (i) solid waste generation and composition, (ii) its physical and chemical properties, (iii) various treatment and disposal options, (iv) associated impactsâ€”both positive and negative, and (v) cross-media concerns related to solid and hazardous waste treatment.</p>

<p><strong> 5. <a href="https://courses.opened.uoguelph.ca/search/publicCourseSearchDetails.do?method=load&courseId=18748">Introduction to Food Processing</strong><be> 
This course examines food processing and the intersections of chemistry, microbiology, and engineering within this field. Topics cover high and low-temperature processes, moisture control including intermediate moisture foods, concentration, dehydration processes, and innovative food processing methods.</p> 
</div>

<p><strong> 6. <a href="https://www.uoguelph.ca/registrar/calendars/undergraduate/2020-2021/courses/food2620.shtml">Food Engineering Principles</strong><be> 
This course provides an overview of engineering fundamentals applied in food processing, encompassing concepts such as heat transfer, fluid dynamics, material and energy balances, as well as instrumentation and process control principles.</p> 

# Co-Instructor:

<div>
    Currently, as a co-instructor, I am teaching two undergraduate courses. 
    <img align="left" width="200" src="/File/NRES338.jpg" style="margin-right: 20px;">
    <p><strong>1. Environmental Field Skills</strong><br>
  This practical laboratory course seeks to provide students with firsthand experience with environmental monitoring field methodologies, using real-world events as a basis. These include of measuring stream discharge, carrying out slug tests, gathering aquatic sample data, carrying out surveys, and drawing wetlands boundaries. Using surrounding areas and watersheds as our classroom, this course aims to give students real-world experience.</p>

    <p><strong>2. Senior Capstone Design</strong><br>
    Through small group projects, students apply the multidisciplinary insights they have learned in class to investigate current environmental issues. Activities for service-learning are included in these projects, which are designed to fit into the semester. Depending on the interests of the students, topics can range from urban gardening to stormwater management. This capstone project connects academia with practical environmental practices by providing chances for professional growth, networking, and hands-on learning.</p>
