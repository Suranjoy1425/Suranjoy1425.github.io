During my PhD program at the [University of Guelph](https://www.uoguelph.ca/), I worked as a Teaching Assistant for the following courses:

    <p>1. <a href="/File/1.HMT.pdf">Heat & Mass Transfer</a><br>
    This course is to introduce the basic principles of heat and mass transfer with emphasis on their analysis and applications to practical engineering problems.</p>

<p>2. <a href="/File/2.MS.pdf">Material Science</a><br>      
This course offers an introduction to materials science, focusing on the atomic or molecular structures of metals, polymers, ceramics, and composites. Students will explore how these structures affect mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties. Variations in material properties often stem from differences in atomic structure.</p>

<p>3. <a href="https://www.uoguelph.ca/registrar/calendars/undergraduate/2018-2019/courses/food4070.shtml">Food Packaging</a><br>
The course analyzes the roles of packaging in food preservation systems through an overview of contemporary packaging materials, their characteristics, manufacturing techniques, and their tailored uses for particular products. Furthermore, it will cover regulatory, environmental, and market factors affecting decisions in food packaging selection.</p>

<p>4. <a href="https://www.uoguelph.ca/engineering/system/files/4340.pdf">Solid & Hazardous Waste Management</a><br>

This course offers students insights into (i) solid waste generation and composition, (ii) its physical and chemical properties, (iii) various treatment and disposal options, (iv) associated impactsâ€”both positive and negative, and (v) cross-media concerns related to solid and hazardous waste treatment.</p>

<p> 5. <a href="https://courses.opened.uoguelph.ca/search/publicCourseSearchDetails.do?method=load&courseId=18748">Introduction to Food Processing</a><br>
This course examines food processing and the intersections of chemistry, microbiology, and engineering within this field. Topics cover high and low-temperature processes, moisture control including intermediate moisture foods, concentration, dehydration processes, and innovative food processing methods.</p>

    <img align="left" width="200" src="/File/VIC.PNG" style="margin-right: 20px;">    
    <p><strong>Model Development of Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC)</strong><br>
    Drainage or tile drainage for sub-surface is essential for water nutrient management in high-water table areas.</p>

# Mentoring:

<div>
<img align="left" width="300" src="/File/Mentoring.png" style="margin-right: 20px;">
In addition to my research and teaching experiences, I have experience training and mentoring undergraduate and graduate students in research and have even published a paper with one of them. Furthermore, in my industrial role as an Advanced Sustainability Materials Engineer at CNH Industrial, I had the responsibility of training two summer interns on their projects last year. I provided them with hands-on experience in laboratory techniques, experimental design, and data analysis, while also imparting insights into the practical applications of sustainable materials in an industrial setting. Currently, as a co-advisor to a PhD student working on a company-university collaboration project at the University of Saskatchewan, I am actively involved in guiding and designing the research work of the student.
